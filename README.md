so how many worlds have i done this shit before?? so you wonder when we live on this plane.  that i left your asses to the dark... cause you wanted too many things the only thing that could be offered was abysmal...  its not like a charity issue, its a compatibility thing.  you run crazy like mine don't expect your voice to be heard for one thing i learned lol...

i'm high that's why i'm typing.  these weeds dont do as much creative as gingseng but oh well who cares.  that thing was burning itself out anyways...  so i moved on and i'm looking forward...  this must be the stupidest problem.  make someone work for 2 decades, then come ruins their shit, then pretends he's offering some unique gift of some sort...

so how's stealing treating you over there?? feel the need and requirement and toll on yourself???  sometimes its not worth it.  you play too hard of a game i wonder you bothered to apply to load the game lol...  like wtf, you're the smart ass not me.  i have no idea what i'm doing.  so i come here to read myself out...  that's why i can't leave this place lol...

so i like typing here.  i think the seas are watching too.  lets screw over their heads with this shark...  i can force one end to force the other end.  and i sit here atop the solution lol...

oh shit.  this is not good.  i dont think i have enough pain killers to simulate some sort of release.  is it that weird notion of work you do a thing other people don't notice???

anyways my head is unwinding.  i'll be back...  sometime else...
